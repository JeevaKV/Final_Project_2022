A new approach for controlling mouse movement using a real-time camera. 
Most existing approaches have been involved to change mouse parts such as adding more buttons or changed the position of the tracking ball.
Instead, we propose to change the hardware design.
 The proposed method overcomes the current shortcomings such as usage of hardware mouse.
 Various movements lead to pains in the hands, is based on a visualization effect of movement followed by computer vision technology, such as image segmentation and gesture recognition.
 To control mouse tasks (left and right clicking, double-clicking, and scrolling)and Machine Learning model.
 We can achieve a better virtual mouse better than the existing ones. Hand gestures are acquired using a camera based .
